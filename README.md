# Sign-Language-and-Detection

Real-time video input from a typical webcam is captured and processed frame by frame to identify, segment, and classify hand gestures as sign language alphabets or words. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of static hand gestures, and it ensures both high accuracy as well as robustness in real-world situations.
